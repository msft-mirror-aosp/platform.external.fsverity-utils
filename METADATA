description: "This is fsverity-utils, a set of userspace utilities for fs-verity.  fs-verity is a Linux kernel feature that does transparent on-demand integrity/authenticity verification of the contents of read-only files, using a hidden Merkle tree (hash tree) associated with the file.  fsverity-utils currently contains just one program, `fsverity`.  The `fsverity` program allows you to set up fs-verity protected files."
